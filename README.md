# Smart Waste Classification System

## Overview
The **Smart Waste Classification System** is a machine learning-based solution designed to automatically detect and classify waste materials from images. This system leverages **MobileNetV2**, a pre-trained deep learning model, for efficient and accurate classification of waste into multiple categories. The goal is to streamline waste management and improve recycling processes through automation.

## Features
- **Automatic Waste Classification**: Identifies and classifies waste materials into 6 categories: Plastic, Paper, Glass, Metal, Organic Waste, and Non-recyclable Items.
- **Transfer Learning**: Utilizes the pre-trained **MobileNetV2** model, which allows for accurate classification with limited data.
- **Image Preprocessing**: Input images are resized to a consistent size (224x224 pixels) to ensure compatibility with the model.
- **Scalable**: The system can be easily adapted for deployment in smart bins, recycling centers, or waste management systems.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language for developing the system.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Deep learning framework used for building and training the classification model.
- **MobileNetV2**: Pre-trained model used as a feature extractor.
- **OpenCV**: Image processing library for resizing and preparing images for model input.
- **ImageDataGenerator**: Data augmentation technique used to improve model generalization during training.

## Waste Categories
The system classifies waste into the following categories:
1. **Plastic**
2. **Paper**
3. **Glass**
4. **Metal**
5. **Organic Waste**
6. **Non-recyclable Items**

## How It Works
1. **Dataset Preparation**:
   The dataset consists of labeled images of various types of waste, organized into categories such as plastic, paper, glass, and others.

2. **Image Preprocessing**:
   Images are resized to a fixed size of `224x224` pixels to match the input requirements of MobileNetV2.

3. **Model Architecture**:
   - The base model **MobileNetV2** is used for feature extraction, leveraging its pre-trained weights from ImageNet.
   - Custom classification layers are added on top of the base model to classify waste into the 6 categories.
   - The model uses **Global Average Pooling** followed by a **Dense layer** and a **Softmax output layer** for multi-class classification.

4. **Training**:
   The model is compiled using the **categorical crossentropy** loss function and **accuracy** as the evaluation metric. Data augmentation is applied to the training set to improve generalization.

5. **Model Output**:
   The trained model classifies new waste images into one of the 6 categories, providing an efficient and automated way to segregate waste.

## Future Enhancements
- **Real-time Waste Detection**: Integrating the system with real-time camera feeds to classify waste as it is thrown into bins.
- **Fine-tuning**: Fine-tuning the model with a larger and more diverse dataset can improve its accuracy.
- **Integration with Smart Bins**: The system can be connected to smart bins, enabling automatic waste segregation and reporting.
